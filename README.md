## Deliverables

### Paper Presentations

Please choose a paper and **sign up** for a presentation slot in the [presentation schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BE7AYdNygbMA1QcU8weLlh-wg-jnq0QJ04GFo6yW8xw/edit?usp=sharing) with your group **by 11 March** (see the corresponding section of the [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1omPjg99B_592PlmTMVlJ7Dtt-6yzdfDW9aqG5S0-7FM/edit?usp=sharing)). If you would like us to match you into a group with somebody else, please also let us know by the same date.

Upload your paper presentation [here](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/D98ToGWyWD7wxFL) by **6 June** using the naming scheme `paper_group_[##]_presentation.[pdf/pptx/key/txt]
`.

### Course Projects

Please choose a project and register it with us **by 16 April** [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1omPjg99B_592PlmTMVlJ7Dtt-6yzdfDW9aqG5S0-7FM/edit?usp=sharing) (be sure to go to the course project sheet, feel free to open an new [discussion]() here to pitch your course project idea to others). 
* Projects presentations – 4 minutes per group – are on **14 May**.
  * Upload [here](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/D98ToGWyWD7wxFL) by **10 am** the same day using the naming scheme `project_group_[##]_presentation.[pdf/pptx/key/txt]`. We will prepare a laptop with all the presentations so that we waste little time between groups.
  * Potential structure:
    * What are you trying to do and why is it relevant?
    * How are you doing it (methods)?
    * What are your preliminary results?
    * What are your pain points?
* By **21 July** you will have to hand in your paper/web app including the replication package. Please use [this link](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/D98ToGWyWD7wxFL) to submit your project using the naming scheme `project_group_[#]_[app/paper].zip`.
